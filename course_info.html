        <b>Piazza</b> Join our <a href="https://piazza.com/stanford/fall2018/cs145">Piazza</a> to receive important
        announcements and get answers to your questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Homeworks</b> Homeworks are self-paced and do not affect your
        course grade. However, they reflect the exam material, so it is in
        your best interest to complete them promptly, for each lecture.
        Aside from preparing you for the exam, they will assess and reinforce
        your understanding of the material.

        You can access the homeworks through <a href="http://www.newgradiance.com/services">Gradiance</a>
        by creating an account (if you don't already have one) then signing
        up for class token <b>E68759F1</b>. Once you have joined the class, navigate
        to the Homeworks section on the left. <b>NOTE:</b> when we write "lab"
        we indicate that you should do the corresponding lab found in the "Lab Projects" tab,
        instead of the Homework tab.
      </p>

      <b>Exam Dates</b>

        to P2 submission difficulties. For more, see piazza post 879).

      <h3 class="subheader">Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Group Size</b> The first two projects are individual only, but the third project you are allowed
        to work in teams of two.
      </p>

        <p>
          <b>Project Submissions</b>
          You will submit your projects via Gradescope. Sign up for Gradescope
          using your Stanford email address and student ID. The course code is
          MJ3ZYR.

          Each assignment will include specific instructions regarding what

        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Regrade Policy</b>
          If you think that we've made a grading mistake or that the work
          you submitted should be regraded, submit a regrade request on
          Gradescope within one week of receiving your grade. Be sure that you
          prepare a short and convincing argument on Gradescope about why you
          think your work was incorrectly graded â€“ we reserve the right to
          ignore your regrade request if you don't provide a justification.

          If you submit a regrade request, we reserve the right to regrade your
          entire assignment. This means that your overall score could go
          down.
